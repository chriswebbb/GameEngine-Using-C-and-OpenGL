<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need [cmake](https://cmake.org/) for this. Can also use cmake to ensure that all make files are in mingw format.

You will also need [mingw32-make](https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/#mingw-builds) for this. Which comes attached when installing Mingw builds. I will make a linux based make file one day :(. To check it's installed.
* make
  ```
  make -v
  ```
* mingw32-make 
  ```
  mingw32-make -v
  ```

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/chriswebbb/GameEngine-Using-C-and-OpenGL
   ```

2. It will come with a program already loaded so to check it all works go into the main directory with 
   ```
   cd ./3DGameInCUsingOpenGL
   ```
3. Then to run the program
   ```
   mingw32-make run
   ```
